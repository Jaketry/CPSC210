# A Brief Introduction to My Personal Project

## A meeting system for four UBC Learning Center

1. What will this application do?\
This application is designed to designed for UBC students who are trying to 
find a place for their group meetings at UBC Learning Center, which is open for 
24 hours. They could choose the room number they want and the time 
they prefer, and then add them to this meeting system if there 
is a seat available for them. They could also cancel the meeting if they want.

2. Who will use it?\
All UBC students could have access to it.

3. Why do I develop this application?\
The logics behind this application can be applied to many occasions, 
even though i choose to apply it to a meeting system. For instance, it 
can be also applied to a ordering system at restaurants. By developing 
this application, skills and experience can also be used to develop similar 
applications for other occasions.
